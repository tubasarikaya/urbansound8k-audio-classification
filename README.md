# UrbanSound8K Audio Classification

This project aims to classify urban sounds using machine learning on the UrbanSound8K dataset.

## Project Overview

The project works with 10 different sound classes recorded in urban environments (air conditioner, car horn, dog bark, drilling sound, etc.). Audio features (MFCC and Mel-spectrogram) were extracted using the Librosa library, and a classification model was developed using the Random Forest algorithm.

Detailed analysis, visualizations, and results are available in the notebook file.
